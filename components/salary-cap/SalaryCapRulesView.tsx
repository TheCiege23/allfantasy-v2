          <div className="space-y-2">
            <FaqItem q="What is a Salary Cap league?">
              A Salary Cap league is a contract-based dynasty format where every player on your roster has a
              salary that counts against your team&apos;s annual cap space. Managing your cap is as important
              as picking the right players — you must keep your total contract commitments under the cap
              each year or face penalties.
            </FaqItem>

            <FaqItem q="How does the salary cap work?">
              Each team starts with the same cap amount (e.g., ${`${c.startupCap}`}). The sum of all active
              player salaries — plus any dead money charges — must stay at or below this number each season.
              The cap can grow annually ({c.capGrowthPercent}% per year by default), rewarding patient
              roster-building over time.
            </FaqItem>

            {c.rolloverEnabled && (
              <FaqItem q="What is cap rollover?">
                Any unspent cap space at the end of a season rolls over into your next season&apos;s budget
                (up to ${`${c.rolloverMax}`} maximum rollover). This rewards lean teams who stay cap-healthy and
                discourages wasteful spending. Rollover cap stacks on top of your base cap the following year.
              </FaqItem>
            )}

            {c.deadMoneyEnabled && (
              <FaqItem q="What is dead money?">
                When you release a player before their contract expires, you owe dead money — a cap charge for
                the remaining commitment you made. Dead money counts 100% against your cap in the current season,
                and {c.deadMoneyPercentPerYear}% of remaining years spill into the following season (max 2 seasons).
                This mechanic punishes over-extension on short-term roster fits.
              </FaqItem>
            )}

            <FaqItem q="How do rookie-scale contracts work?">
              After your startup draft or any future rookie draft, drafted players automatically receive
              contracts at their pick-position salary. Early picks receive higher salaries (reflecting
              their higher expected value); later picks are cheaper. Contracts last {c.rookieContractYears} years
              by default. This mirrors real-world entry-level deals — high picks command premium cap space,
              while late picks offer cap flexibility.
            </FaqItem>

            {c.startupDraftType === 'snake' && (
              <FaqItem q="How does the snake salary scale assign salaries?">
                In a snake salary-scale draft, each pick slot maps to a predetermined salary based on the
                league&apos;s cap size and configured curve (steep, linear, or flat). Pick 1.01 receives the
                maximum salary (~4.5% of cap); picks in later rounds receive progressively less, down to the
                minimum salary floor (${`${c.minimumSalary}`}). This creates a predictable, transparent market
                where draft position equals contractual commitment — no bidding required.
              </FaqItem>
            )}

            {c.startupDraftType === 'auction' && (
              <FaqItem q="How does the startup auction work?">
                In an auction draft, each team nominates players and all teams bid simultaneously. The highest
                bidder wins the player and that bid becomes the player&apos;s salary for the initial contract
                term. A holdback of ${`${c.auctionHoldback}`} is reserved until the draft completes — this
                prevents teams from spending all their cap in the early rounds. Final cap compliance is
                checked after the holdback is released.
              </FaqItem>
            )}

            <FaqItem q="How does FAAB work in a salary cap league?">
              FAAB and free agency work through your cap space, not a separate budget. To sign a free agent
              mid-season, the salary you offer counts against your available cap. You cannot sign a player if
              the salary would push you over your cap limit. This means unlike standard leagues, you can&apos;t
              simply outbid everyone — you need cap room.
            </FaqItem>

            {c.extensionsEnabled && (
              <FaqItem q="How do contract extensions work?">
                Each team can extend one player per season. Extensions add up to 3 additional years to a
                player&apos;s contract before it expires. Salary for the extension years is calculated based on
                either a performance formula or a stable continuation of the existing deal (commissioner&apos;s
                choice). Extensions lock a player to your roster — you can&apos;t extend then immediately cut.
              </FaqItem>
            )}

            {c.franchiseTagEnabled && (
              <FaqItem q="How does the franchise tag work?">
                The franchise tag lets you retain one expiring player per offseason at a premium salary — the
                average of the top 8 salaries at that position. Tagged players receive a 1-year contract at
                that rate. You can only franchise-tag each player once across their career in your league.
                The tag prevents losing elite players to free agency but costs premium cap space.
              </FaqItem>
            )}

            <FaqItem q="What contract year allocations are allowed?">
              The number of multi-year contracts each team can hold is limited by allocation rules:
              1-year contracts are unlimited; 2-year contracts are capped at 3 per team; 3-year contracts
              at 2; 4-year contracts at 1. This mirrors real-world salary structures and prevents
              teams from stacking massive long-term deals at every position.
            </FaqItem>

            <FaqItem q="What is the difference between salary cap dynasty and standard dynasty?">
              Standard dynasty leagues track wins and losses based on player points — roster management is
              purely about acquiring and stashing the best players. Salary cap dynasty adds a financial
              dimension: every player has a cost, every move has cap implications, and financial discipline
              becomes a skill layer on top of talent evaluation. You can&apos;t simply collect every good
              player — you have to make hard choices about value vs. salary.
