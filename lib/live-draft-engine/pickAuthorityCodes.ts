/**
 * Pick authority error codes (Commit M).
 *
 * Stable identifiers attached to every refusal returned by the canonical
 * pick-write path (`PickSubmissionService.submitPick` and the routes that
 * wrap it). The codes let the client render a precise inline error
 * (instead of redirecting / generic 400) and make race-vs-validation
 * distinctions auditable.
 *
 * Mapping convention (route -> HTTP status):
 *   DRAFT_PICK_NOT_LIVE          → 400  (draft not in progress)
 *   DRAFT_PICK_NOT_ON_CLOCK      → 403  (this roster is not on the clock,
 *                                       and caller is not commissioner)
 *   DRAFT_PICK_DUPLICATE_PLAYER  → 400  (player already drafted)
 *   DRAFT_PICK_STALE_OVERALL     → 409  (client expectedOverall != server
 *                                       picksCount + 1; refresh and retry)
 *   DRAFT_PICK_RACE_RETRY        → 409  (transaction detected concurrent
 *                                       commit; retry safe)
 *
 * Stale-overall and race-retry are both 409 because the client recovery is
 * the same: refresh session snapshot and resubmit with the new
 * `expectedOverall`. The Commit J in-place session-mismatch handler can
 * key off these codes without redirecting.
