/**
 * Phase 2C — Ranking Snapshot Engine
 *
 * Pure composition. Given imported-history per source + per-league
 * difficulty ratings, produces a `RankingSnapshot` (shape in `lib/ranking/types`).
 *
 * Hard rules:
 *   - No I/O. Persisting snapshots arrives in Batch 2.
 *   - No magic numbers — all constants in `./weights.ts`.
 *   - Safe with empty / missing inputs.
 *   - Output rating fields are always finite and clamped.
