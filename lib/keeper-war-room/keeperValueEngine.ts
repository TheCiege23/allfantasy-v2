 * KEEPER VALUE ENGINE — pure, deterministic. No AI, no fabrication.

 *  1. SEASON value — how good the player is this year (projection → season avg → ADP).
 *     Used by needs/lineup/trade/waivers.
 *  2. KEEPER SURPLUS — draft-capital value of keeping them: keeperCostRound − adpRound
 *     (positive = you keep a higher-value player for a later/cheaper pick). The core
 *     keep/cut signal. Requires both an ADP value AND a real keeper cost; null otherwise.
