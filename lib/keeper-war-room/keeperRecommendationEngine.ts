/**
 * KEEPER RECOMMENDATION ENGINE — pure, deterministic. No AI, no fabrication.

 * Picks the BEST keeper set for a roster within the league's keeper limit, ranked by

 * the bubble (next-best just outside the limit), and a limited-data flag when keeper cost
 * or value is unavailable. Honest: never invents costs or values.
