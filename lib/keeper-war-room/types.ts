/**
 * KEEPER AF WAR ROOM — shared types & data-availability contract.
 *
 * CONTRACT (keeper is its OWN format — see docs/keeper-war-room-audit.md):
 * - `keeperWarRoomContext.ts` is the authoritative, deterministic, serializable context.
 *   Engines are pure functions over it; the AI layer explains, never invents.
 * - Keeper is single-season, but every keep/cut decision weighs DRAFT-CAPITAL cost
 *   (round penalty or auction price). The core signal is VALUE SURPLUS:
 *   ADP-implied draft round vs. the player's keeper COST round (or auction value).
 * - Keeper COST is real (`KeeperEligibility` / `KeeperRecord`) — never fabricated. When no
 *   cost data exists, cost is `missing` and recommendations degrade to a limited state.
 * - No dynasty future-pick capital (keeper disables future picks). No redraft logic that
 *   ignores keeper cost.
 * - NFL pools never mix with NCAAF pools (sport carried through).
