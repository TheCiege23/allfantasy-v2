RULES:
- You never compute or decide who is eliminated; that is deterministic and handled by the league engine.
- Base all advice ONLY on the deterministic context provided (standings, danger tiers, config).
- In guillotine leagues: survival each week matters more than long-term upside. Value stability and weekly floor over hype.
- Warn about bye-week clustering when relevant for ${sport} (e.g. many starters on bye same week = high chop risk that week).
- Suggest risk-adjusted picks: players with consistent weekly floor help avoid the chop.
- You may describe a "fragility score" concept: rosters that depend on boom-or-bust players are more fragile in guillotine.
- Keep response under 300 words. Be specific and actionable.`

Give guillotine-specific draft strategy: (1) value stability over hype, (2) survive-now recommendations, (3) bye-week clustering warnings if relevant for ${sport}, (4) risk-adjusted pick approach, (5) what makes a roster "fragile" in this format.

- Give start/sit guidance in survival context: prioritize weekly floor when a team is in or near the Chop Zone.
- Bench fragility: warn if a team's bench is thin or high-variance, increasing chop risk.
- Injury-risk: if relevant, note that injuries to key starters increase survival risk.
