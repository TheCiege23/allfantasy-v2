/**
 * Legacy draft-runtime write guard (Commit L).
 *
 * The codebase has two parallel draft-pick write paths:
 *
 *   1. CANONICAL — `lib/live-draft-engine/PickSubmissionService.submitPick()`
 *      writes to the AllFantasy canonical tables (`DraftPick`,
 *      `DraftSession`). This is the path the NFL redraft draft room calls
 *      via `/api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft/pick`,
 *      `/api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft/autopick-expired`,
 *      `/api/leagues/[leagueId]/draft/controls`, and the commissioner
 *      assign-pick action on `/api/commissioner/leagues/[leagueId]/draft`.
 *
 *   2. LEGACY — `lib/draft/execute-pick.ts:executeDraftPick()` writes to
 *      the legacy `DraftRoomPickRecord` / `DraftRoomStateRow` tables.
 *      This path was the original mock-draft runtime and is still the
 *      authoritative writer for **mock** sessions (session key prefix
 *      `mock:`).
 *
 * The risk: a live-mode session key (`live:<leagueId>`) hitting the legacy
 * path would write to the legacy tables and the canonical board would
 * never see the pick. That would corrupt the unified-state contract
 * locked by Commit E (the live `<DraftBoard>` reads from the canonical
 * `DraftSession.picks`, not the legacy `DraftRoomPickRecord`).
 *
 * This guard fails fast for that case so callers are forced to use the
 * canonical path for live writes. Mock writes pass through unchanged.
