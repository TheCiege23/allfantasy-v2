 * - Draft: `draft.tick` / `draft.autoPick` drive live draft clock + autopick.
 * - Scoring: `scoring.sync` batches provider stat sync + weekly scoring snapshots.
 * - Trades: `trades.process` handles review windows + ledger updates.
 * - League concepts: guillotine / survivor / big brother batch steps call into specialty engines.
