/**
 * AI Host Operating Rules — defines how the AI host runs the Survivor game.

 * The AI host must:
 * - Create weekly challenges (varied types, balanced rewards)
 * - Track who has received too much power (power density check)
 * - Avoid unfair targeting (no AI-chosen eliminations)
 * - Validate submission deadlines and lock answers
 * - Log every result (SurvivorAuditEntry)
 * - Keep secrets correctly (never leak private data)
 * - Reveal outcomes in the correct tone (dramatic for council, neutral for scoring)
