/**
 * SURVIVOR BALLOT ELIGIBILITY — pure, deterministic. No DB, no AI.
 *
 * Computes who may vote and who may be voted for at a Tribal Council from an already-loaded
 * scope of active players plus the safety sets produced by idol plays / settings. The caller
 * (survivorCouncilService) loads players and idol plays; this module only applies the rules so
 * the logic is unit-testable without a database. Distinct filename from the legacy PascalCase
 * `SurvivorCouncilEligibility.ts` (Windows case-insensitive FS) — this is the canonical Phase 3
 * version keyed by userId, not rosterId.
