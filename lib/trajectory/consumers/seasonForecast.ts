/**
 * Trajectory Foundation — Season Forecast consumer composition.
 *
 * The first real consumer glue (Dashboard V2 Phase 3.4). Composes the generic
 * service + the Season Forecast adapter + the compact summary into a per-team,
 * per-field trajectory the Season Outlook card can render directly.
 *
 * Lives in `consumers/` (not `adapters/`) so the adapter stays pure — this layer
 * is allowed to depend on the service. It does NO IO of its own: the caller (the
 * API route) performs a single snapshot read and passes the rows in, so building
 * every team's trajectory costs one query, not one-per-team.
