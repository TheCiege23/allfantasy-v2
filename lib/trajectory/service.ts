/**
 * Trajectory Foundation — the Snapshot History Service (Deliverable 2).
 *
 * The one reusable entry point. Given ANY `TrajectoryAdapter` and its params it
 * returns the metric's current value, previous value, delta, timestamp, and full
 * history in the common `Trajectory` shape — the single, trustworthy source for
 * "what changed and why" across every Decision OS module.
 *
 * The service is deliberately thin and generic: it owns no metric-specific logic
 * (that lives in adapters) and no math (that lives in the pure delta engine). It
 * orchestrates: load → derive → explain, and propagates the adapter's honest
 * `supported` flag so a current-state-only metric can never masquerade as a trend.
