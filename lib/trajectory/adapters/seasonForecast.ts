/**
 * Trajectory Foundation — Season Forecast adapter (Deliverable 3, flagship
 * SUPPORTED source).
 *
 * `SeasonForecastSnapshot` stores exactly one real row per `(leagueId, season,
 * week)` (see `lib/season-forecast/warehouse-integration.ts`), so week-over-week
 * movement in playoff odds, championship odds, expected wins, seed, etc. is
 * GENUINE captured history — not a computed guess. Each team forecast also ships
 * the engine's own `confidenceScore`, which we pass through as the point's
 * confidence (never invented).
 *
 * The normalization is a pure function (`mapSeasonForecastPoints`) so it is
 * testable without a DB; the DB read is isolated behind injectable deps.
