/**
 * Rooting Guide Calculator
 *
 * For a specific entry, answer: "Who do you need to win each upcoming match?"
 *
 * For every pending match the entry has a pick on:
 *   - rootFor = the team they picked (obvious, but surfaced clearly)
 *   - threatsAbove = how many higher-ranked entries picked the opposite team
 *   - maxRankGain = if my team wins AND all threats above lose, how many ranks do I gain?
 *   - urgency = how important is this match for this entry?
 *
 * The topNeed is the single most impactful upcoming match for this entry.
