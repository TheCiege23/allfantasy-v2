/**
 * Champion Pick Leverage Calculator
 *
 * In bracket competitions (WC, March Madness, etc.), the champion pick is
 * worth a large number of points and is made up-front. This calculator
 * measures how much leverage — differentiation advantage — each champion
 * pick gives in the pool.
 *
 * High leverage = few others picked the same team AND points are large.
 * Chalk = most popular pick. Contrarian = picked by 15–39%.
 * Rare = picked by fewer than 15% of entries.
