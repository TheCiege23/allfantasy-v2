/**
 * Upset Impact Calculator
 *
 * For each upcoming match, assume the less-popular pick wins (the "upset").
 * Compute: who gains, who loses, does the leader take a hit, how dramatic is it?
 *
 * "favorite" = the team more pool entries picked (not necessarily Vegas favorite).
 * "underdog" = the team fewer pool entries picked.
 *
 * impactLabel:
 *   "pool-shaking" = chaos ≥ 8 AND the leader would lose points
 *   "significant"  = chaos ≥ 6
 *   "moderate"     = chaos ≥ 4
 *   "low"          = chaos < 4 or heavily one-sided
